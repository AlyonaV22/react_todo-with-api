Author ----- Olena Verbanova

Project Overview
This project is a React-based Todo List application that seamlessly integrates with an API, allowing users to add, delete, edit, and toggle tasks efficiently. The app ensures smooth interactions, proper state management, and user-friendly error handling.

Features

Adding and Deleting Todos
✅ Users can effortlessly add new tasks.
✅ Tasks can be deleted with a single click.

🔄 Toggling Task Status
✅ Each task's completion status can be switched between "completed" and "not completed."
✅ A loading overlay appears while waiting for the API response.
✅ The status updates only after API confirmation.
✅ If an error occurs, a notification alerts the user.
✅ A "Toggle All" button allows users to update the status of all tasks at once:
✅ The button is active only when all tasks are completed.
✅ Clicking it updates only the necessary tasks, avoiding redundant API requests.

✏️ Editing Todo Titles
✅ Double-clicking on a task enables editing mode.
✅ An input field replaces the title and delete button.
✅ Changes are saved when:
✅ The user presses Enter.
✅ The input field loses focus (onBlur).
Editing is canceled if:
✅ The user presses the Esc key.
✅ The new title is the same as the old one.
✅ If the title is empty, the task is automatically deleted, just like using the delete button.
A loading indicator is shown while the title is updated.
In case of an API error, an error message is displayed.

Additional Enhancements
🚀 Optimized API interactions to avoid unnecessary requests.
⚡ Error handling for both updates and deletions ensures a smooth user experience.
🛠️ Well-structured, interactive, and responsive—making this a robust and user-friendly Todo app.
